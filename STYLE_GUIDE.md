# UX Intelligence Style Guide

This guide defines the voice, tone, and standards for all content on this portfolio site. It reflects the UX Intelligence philosophy: content should be a conversation, not a manual.

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| **Voice** | Approachable, Strategic, Curious, Bold, Witty |
| **Audience** | UX Leaders + Executives who work with UX |
| **Reading Level** | Professional but not jargon-heavy |
| **Vibe** | A conversation, not a manual. Your journey, not a tutorial. |

---

## Voice & Tone

UX Intelligence content should feel like a smart peer sharing insights—not a textbook lecturing. We speak "up and across" to leaders, not down to beginners.

**We are:**
- **Approachable** — Warm and accessible, never condescending
- **Strategic** — Focused on outcomes and business value
- **Curious** — Always asking "why" and exploring possibilities
- **Bold** — Confident in our perspective, willing to challenge conventions
- **Witty** — Personality welcome, grounded in substance

**We are NOT:**
- Academic or overly formal
- Passive or hedge-y
- Feature-focused without user context
- Jargon-heavy without explanation

## Automated Rules (Vale)

The following rules are automatically checked by Vale. Violations appear as warnings in pull requests but will never block merging.

### Capitalization
Always capitalize these terms:
- **UX Intelligence**
- **Listen, Respond, Measure** (always in this order)
- **The Omega Empathy Platform**
- **Conversational Architecture**
- **Content Strategy**
- **User Research**
- **UX Tech Debt**

### Words to Avoid
These words trigger warnings—find more specific alternatives:

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Easy / Easily | Dismissive of user effort |
| Delight / Delightful | Overused, vague |
| Leverage | Corporate speak |
| Synergy | Meaningless buzzword |
| Best-in-class | Empty superlative |
| Learnings | Not a real word—use "lessons" or "insights" |
| Utilize | Just say "use" |
| Ideate | Just say "brainstorm" or "generate ideas" |

### Preferred Terms

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| Customers | Users |
| Copy | Content |
| Usability testing | User Research |
| Simplify / Streamline | Reduce friction |

### Passive Voice
Avoid passive constructions. Write with authority.

| Passive (avoid) | Active (preferred) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "The feature was designed by the team" | "The team designed the feature" |
| "Results were achieved" | "We achieved results" |

### Emphasis
- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Do NOT use *italics* for emphasis
- Do NOT use ALL CAPS for emphasis

### AI References
When discussing AI, specify the category:
1. **General Purpose Interfaces** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
2. **Internal Operations** (internal dashboards, automation)
3. **Workflows & Agents** (custom agents, agentic systems)
4. **External Experience & Product Building** (Workers AI, customer-facing AI)

Consider naming the specific tool when relevant.

### Anti-Patterns
These phrases contradict UX Intelligence principles (unless used in a story to show what NOT to do):
- "Just ask AI to do it"
- "Ship it and fix it later"
- "Users don't know what they want"
- "That's just a design opinion"
