# Main Content Starts Here

Write your blog post content in markdown format. This is just a template to help you get started.

## Section Header

You can add paragraphs of text. Markdown makes it easy to format your content without worrying about HTML.

Here's another paragraph. Notice how there's a blank line between paragraphs.

### Subsection

Use three hashes for smaller subheadings.

## Formatting Examples

**Bold text** for emphasis.

*Italic text* for subtle emphasis.

***Bold and italic*** for maximum emphasis.

## Lists

Unordered lists:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

Ordered lists:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Links and Images

[Link to external site](https://example.com)

To add images, place them in the `public/images/` folder, then reference them:

![Image description](/images/your-image.png)

## Quotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it for highlighting important statements or quotes from others.

## Code

Inline code: Use `backticks` for inline code.

Code blocks:
```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("This is a code block");
}
```

## Final Tips

- Keep paragraphs concise and focused
- Use headers to break up long content
- Include images to make posts more engaging
- Link to relevant resources
- Proofread before publishing!

## Categories to Use

Based on your design mockups:
- "UX as a Product"
- "Featured" (set `featured: true` in frontmatter)
